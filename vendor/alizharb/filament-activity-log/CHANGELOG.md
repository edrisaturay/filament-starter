## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- **Filament v5 Support** - Package now supports both Filament v4 and v5
  - Dual version constraint: `^4.0|^5.0` for seamless compatibility

- **Batch Support** - Added `View Batch` action to group activities by request/job UUID.
- **Cluster Support** - Added `cluster()` configuration method to `ActivityLogPlugin` for nesting the resource in Filament Clusters.

### Improved

- **Localization** - Completed translation coverage for all supported languages.

### Changed

- **Minimum Laravel Version** - Updated to Laravel 11+ for optimal compatibility
- **Dependencies** - Updated Filament packages to support v4 and v5

### Technical Details

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed

- **Navigation Group Plugin Integration** - Fixed issue where `navigationGroup()` set on the plugin was not being used by the resource

  - Example: `'custom_authorization' => fn($user) => $user->id === 1`

- **Documentation**
  - Added `CONFIGURATION.md` - Comprehensive configuration guide with navigation and authorization examples
  - Added `SOLUTIONS.md` - Direct solutions to common configuration issues

### Changed

- **ActivityLogResource** - Updated navigation methods to prioritize plugin settings
  - `getNavigationGroup()` - Checks plugin first, then config
  - `getNavigationSort()` - Checks plugin first, then config
  - `getNavigationIcon()` - Checks plugin first, then config
  - `getNavigationBadge()` - Checks plugin first, then config

- **ActivityPolicy** - Enhanced `viewAny()` method to support custom authorization callbacks
  - Custom callback checked first before permission system
  - Provides flexible authorization without Laravel permissions

- **README.md** - Added references to new configuration documentation and custom authorization examples

### Technical Details
