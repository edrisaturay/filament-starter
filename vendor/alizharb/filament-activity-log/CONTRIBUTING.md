## Support Questions

Please do not use the issue tracker for support questions.

## Bug Reports

To encourage active collaboration, we encourage you to open pull requests instead of just filing bugs. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing test.

However, if you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.
